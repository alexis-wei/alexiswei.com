          Apple is the golden standard that many of us designers and engineers
          get inspiration fromâ€”it&apos;s where we go to find best practices and
          new design patterns. From admiring them for so many years, I thought
          it would be a good idea to actually do a deep dive of their page, pay
          attention to the nitty gritty details that makes their website stand
          out the way that it is, share my learnings and anything I find through
          this experiment.

          Learning how to do all the scroll detection animations with GSAP
          ScrollTrigger. It&apos;s kind of weird actually trying to use this
          instead of the built in eventListeners that I&apos;m so used to using
          but this makes scroll animations so much easier and smoother with much
          less code

          Something that I didn&apos;t expect to learn from here is better use
          of css variables. it&apos;s really interesting to see how Apple does
          their sizing calculations in relation to screen. They use a vw
          relative and has a min and max value for media sizing.
