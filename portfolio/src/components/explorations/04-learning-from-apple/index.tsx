          Apple is the golden standard that many of us designers and engineers
          get inspiration fromâ€”it's where we go to find best practices and new
          design patterns. From admiring them for so many years, I thought it
          would be a good idea to actually do a deep dive of their page, pay
          attention to the nitty gritty details that makes their website stand
          out the way that it is, share my learnings and anything I find through
          this experiment.
